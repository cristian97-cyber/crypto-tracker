# Crypto Tracker

This is a web application that shows data about the cryptocurrencies world, including real-time stats and news. I built this app using React, Next.js and Material UI.

The web application use the following APIs:

- https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api to collect general stats and exchanges info
- https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5734027/RzZ6Hzr3?version=latest to collect coins and market data
- https://api.coinpaprika.com/ to retrieve historical price charts
- https://newsdata.io/ to search latest news about cryptos

A demo is available on the following URL: https://cryptotrackersite.vercel.app/.
